# EoS_Iso

Programs to calculate Isovector and Isoscalar values of a given nuclear EoS. Parameters calculated include the Slope and Curavature Values at saturation and reference density. Input requires EoS of Symmetric and Neutron Nuclear Matter. Truncation Error can be calculated if Chiral EoS is used. 


Temporary repo, will delete once ISOV is uploaded
